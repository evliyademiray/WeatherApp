In this project, I created  Weather App for Turkey Provinces.

Used Redux Toolkit for state management.

Used React-Router-Dom for create page from components.

Used turkey-map-react for Turkey map.

Used Axios for API requests.

Used https://openweathermap.org/ for weather datas.

Used json-server for info about cities in Turkey.


As a general, This project have three main components, List of Cities, Map of Turkey and DetailPage.

On List Page,  there is cities and searchbar. Thatâ€™s why you can filter the cities and see weather information.

On Map page, You can click any city and see weather information of city.

On the DetailPage, yau are able to see info of city such as temp, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, longitude, latitude, population, region and next 5 days temps.
